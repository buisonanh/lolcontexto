Role: TANK
Description: Singed is a Zaunite alchemist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledgeâ€”with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.
