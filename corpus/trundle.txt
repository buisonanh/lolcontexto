Name: trundle
Role: FIGHTER
Description: Trundle is a hulking and devious troll with a particularly vicious streak, and there is nothing he cannot bludgeon into submissionâ€”not even the Freljord itself. Fiercely territorial, he chases down anyone foolish enough to enter his domain. Then, his massive club of True Ice at the ready, he chills his enemies to the bone and impales them with jagged, frozen pillars, laughing as they bleed out onto the tundra.
