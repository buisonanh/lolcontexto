Name: kayn
Role: FIGHTER
Description: A peerless practitioner of lethal shadow magic, Shieda Kayn battles to achieve his true destinyâ€”to one day lead the Order of Shadow into a new era of Ionian supremacy. He wields the sentient darkin weapon Rhaast, undeterred by its creeping corruption of his body and mind. There are only two possible outcomes: either Kayn bends the weapon to his will... or the malevolent blade consumes him completely, paving the way for the destruction of all Runeterra.
