Name: seraphine
Role: MAGE
Description: Born in Piltover to Zaunite parents, Seraphine can hear the souls of othersâ€”the world sings to her, and she sings back. Though these sounds overwhelmed her in her youth, she now draws on them for inspiration, turning the chaos into a symphony. She performs for the sister cities to remind their citizens that they're not alone, that they're stronger together, and that, in her eyes, their potential is limitless.
