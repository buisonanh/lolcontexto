Name: lissandra
Role: MAGE
Description: Lissandra's magic twists the pure power of ice into something dark and terrible. With the force of her black ice, she does more than freezeâ€”she impales and crushes those who oppose her. To the terrified denizens of the north, she is known only as ''The Ice Witch.'' The truth is much more sinister: Lissandra is a corruptor of nature who plots to unleash an ice age on the world.
